# USACO
My solutions for USACO problems!

Each folder will contain the source code for a problem in any language I can solve it, the input file (the newer question that read from stdin and print to stdout will also have an input file so I don't have to type in the input). Each folder also contains the question pdf. 

Most of the files here will pass the test cases, but if a file doesn't, and comment will be put at the top of the file.
